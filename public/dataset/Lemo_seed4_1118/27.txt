Lemo raised both hands to show off his muscles, displaying two tattoos on each bicep: one with a circular pattern and the other with a geometric design. Lemo is wearing red swimming trunks with a white logo on the right side. In the background, the sky is a deep blue, gradually turning to a pinkish hue near the horizon. A small boat with white sails floats on the calm blue sea. To the right of the character, there is a beach chair with green and white stripes, and to the left, there is a yellow and red canister with a metallic top. The sand is a light beige color, and the entire scene exudes a cheerful summer vibe.
